# CunySecond-API

## Getting started:
1. One of the libraries being used here is an open-source Firebase Java wrapper and it doesn't exist on any online central repository so it can't be imported via Maven. You need to clone that [repo](https://github.com/bane73/firebase4j) yourself and install it via Maven. After you do that, the dependency in the pom file will work.
